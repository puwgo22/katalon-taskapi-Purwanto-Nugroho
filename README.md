Project API Testing for Automated Testing with Katalon Studio in TAK 2024 Batch 8

# **Objective**
This application focuses on how the API works by testing all API end points.

# App Usage Guide
## **Requirements that must be inserted before running this application are :**
* Using Groovy language based on Katalon Studio ```version 9.7.2```
* Testing is done on the End-Point API provided by [herokuapp](restful-booker.herokuapp.com)
* Testing was carried out with the Google Chrome Website Browser ```Version 130.0.6723.91``` (Official Build)

## **Summary of Testing Results**
In the implementation of testing, testing was carried out on 4 Test Cases with the results:
```
4 Passed
0 Failed
0 Not Executed
```
So the test result is 100% Passed

## **Report**
In testing, if you have to test one test case at a time, it will take a long time, so a Test Suite is made, so that you can run several test cases simultaneously, namely:
```TS - Activity_Booking```
which consists of 4 test cases, namely
```
TC - Create_BookingID
TC - Get_BookingID
TC - Update_BookingID
TC - Delete_BookingID
```
